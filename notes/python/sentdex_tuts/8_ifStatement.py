# IF statement and assignment operators

x = 5
y = 8
z = 5
a = 3

# Simple
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")

# This is getting noisy and clutered
if z < y > x > a:
    print("y is greater than z and greather than x which is greater than a")

if z <= x:
    print("z is less than or equal to x")
