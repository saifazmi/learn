FAQ
====

- What is the shebang line? #!/usr/bin/python

A: Notifies linux of the path to python so that the script can be run as
an executable. Useless for Windows

- In modules what is the following?
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("such great module")

A: The above line of code prevents the module from running as soon as it
has been imported in another script. This makes sure that the specific print
statement only runs when the module is being run on it on and not when it is
being imported by other programs without calling any functions.

Without that if statement the print() will run as soon as another script runs
"import module_name."

The if satement asks if the module while is the __main__ file being executed.
