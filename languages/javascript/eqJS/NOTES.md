# NOTES

## History

- introduced in 1995
- part of Netscape Navigator browser
- has been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers

### Standardisation and ECMAScript

After adoption outside Netscape, a standard documentation was written to describe the way the language should work, this was done to ensure standardisation across multiple applications clamming to support the language. This resulted in the _ECMAScript_ standard and the term ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably.

### Version Timeline

- **ECMAScript 3:** widely supported; available during JS rise to dominance roughly b/w 2000 and 2010.
- **ECMAScript 4:** planned a number of radical improvement and extensions, but the changes were not popular and v4 was abandoned in 2008.
- **ECMAScript 5:** made few uncontroversial improvements and came out in 2009.
- **ECMAScript 6:** brought major updates which included ideas initially planned for v4; came out in 2015.
- New small updates yearly since ES6.

## Basic Use

- enables interaction with websites
- allows for reload of parts of the application (SPA's)

## Other applications

JavaScript is also used outside the web browser:

### Databases

MongoDB and CouchDB use JS as their scripting and query language.

### Desktop and Server

Node.js provides an environment for programming JS outside of the browser.
