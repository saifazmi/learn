# JavaScript Patterns

Angular relies heavily on the functional nature of JS.

- Functions as abstractions
- Functions to build modules
- Functions to avoid global variables

## Functions as abstractions

### Code

```javascript
var work = function() {
    console.log("working hard!");
};

var doWork = function(f) {

    console.log("starting");

    try {
        f();
    } catch(ex) {
        console.error(ex);
    }

    console.log("end");
};

doWork(work);
```

- Notice how `doWork()` takes a _`function`_ as a parameter.
- The _`function`_ is not invoked, which will pass the result of the _`function`_ as the parameter, but rather invoked internally by `doWork()`.

### Result

```
starting
working hard!
end
```

## Functions to build modules

Sometimes we need more than just simple functions, like a whole `Object` containing properties and functions.

- This pattern is also referred to as the _**revealing module pattern**_
- It's a **module**, because it is a collection of components or features put together to perform some useful work.

### Code

```javascript
var createWorker = function() {

    var workCount = 0;

    var task1 = function() {
        workCount += 1;
        console.log("task1 " + workCount);
    };

    var task2 = function() {
        workCount += 1;
        console.log("task2 " + workCount);
    };

    return {
        job1: task1, // example of aliasing
        job2: task2  // these can have the same name i.e. job2: job2
    };
};

var worker = createWorker();

worker.job1();
worker.job2();
worker.job2();
worker.job2();
```

### Result

```
task1 1
task2 2
task2 3
task2 4
```

## Functions to avoid global variables

In the code example above we end up with two _Global_ variables, namely `createWorker` and `worker`. Having _globals_ is never a good idea and in JavaScript its just evil, as JS is a dynamically typed language, it can lead to bugs if overwritten and also because it will have a shared state.

- One quick way to reduce the global variables will be to wrap it all in a single _`function`_ and simply call that one function

```javascript
var program = function() {

    var createWorker = function() {
        ...
    };

    var worker = createWorker();

    worker.job1();
    worker.job2();
    worker.job2();
    worker.job2();
};

program();
```

- The above example reduces the number of _global_ variables from two to one, but we will like to get to zero _globals_ and to achieve that we can do the following:

```javascript
function() {

    var createWorker = function() {
        ...
    };

    var worker = createWorker();

    worker.job1();
    worker.job2();
    worker.job2();
    worker.job2();
}();
```

- In the above example we have removed the function name and at the end of the function declaration we have appended parentheses `()`, this is known as **self invocation**.
- But JavaScript doesn't like the above syntax; where an anonymous function is just sitting there invoking itself. We can fix this by doing the following:

```javascript
(function() {

    var createWorker = function() {
        ...
    };

    var worker = createWorker();

    worker.job1();
    worker.job2();
    worker.job2();
    worker.job2();
}());
```

- Now we have wrapped the whole _`function`_ in `()` parentheses.
- In JavaScript this is known as an _**Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**_
